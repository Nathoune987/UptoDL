This folder contains all the resources necessary for UptoDL to function properly. You must not delete any of its files and folders, or you will get errors.

Explanation of each file/folder:

- /dl_temp : It is in this folder that the two multimedia sources will be downloaded and then assembled by the program.
- /PluggableTransports : In this folder there are two executable files necessary for "tor.exe", used for proxies.
- /Tor : In this folder there are still files necessary to "tor.exe" for the configuration of proxies.
- ffmpeg.exe : This executable file is used in the program to assemble the audio and video into one final video.
- firefox_path.json : UptoDL needs Firefox to work, so at the first startup, the path of Firefox is requested and stored in this JSON file to not have to mention it anymore.
- geckodriver.exe : This executable file allows the "SeleniumWire" module to control firefox.
- tor.exe : It's just the Tor service to use as a proxy.
